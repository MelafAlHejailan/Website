  <h3 style="color:orange"> The story of the invention of pizza </h3><br><br>
<p> Did you know that pizza is now about 200 years old and although people have created pizza-like foods that have spread widely around the world,
But most culinary authors agree that delicious pizza dishes, covered with oil, spices and vegetables, are Mediterranean-made, including ancient Egyptians and Greeks.</br> </br> 
Historian Cato the Great, author of the history of Rome in the 3rd century BC, mentions pizza-like pizza covered with olives, vegetables and spices. 
In 72 AD before the outbreak of Vesuvius.</br>
By the mid-19th century, food covered with herbs, vegetables and cheese was one of the most important foods on the streets of Naples, Italy, where the Italian King Umberto I visited the city in 1889, 
according to a legend summoned the queen owner of the pizzeria de Pietro named Raffaele Esposito to prepare these foods for her.</br></br>
This man invented three forms of baked goods, one of which is tomato, basil and cheese and represents the three colors of the flag of Italy. 
Although many historians question this man's invention of pizza margarita, pizza is an integral part of cooking in Naples.</br></br>
In 2009, the European Union set some standards for the work of Italian-Naples pizza to preserve heritage, and with many Italians flocking to the United States during 
World War I and II, they brought with them how to make pizza and pizza spread in New York City and the first restaurant opened in Chicago in 1943. 
The invention of frozen pizza in the 1950s, and the opening of Pizza Hut Pizza in 1960. Today, pizza is one of the most common commercial activities in the world.</br></br></p>
